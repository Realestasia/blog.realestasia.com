title: Welcome to Realestasia
---

Thanks for joining us as we launch Realestasia to the world.
As far as first posts go, this will be relatively simple and straight forward. We hope you will stick around
as we continue to build Realestasia into the most transparent new development property site in Asia.

<h3>Who are you and what are you doing?</h3>
Realestasia is a listing platform featuring only new or first-hand developments in Asia. Developers and agents 
list detailed information and photos of their latest property developments. Potential investors 
are free to browse the developments and make contact with those developers that best fit specific investment or
lifestyle criteria.

Like many others, we have also been on the receiving end of the glossy sales pitches and high-pressure tactics at property expos and wanted to
create something that better serves the buyer's needs. On Realestasia, the buyer can browse and compare developments,
countries and markets at their own pace. Once you've identified some good options, it is your decision which developers 
you make contact with to move forward for inspections and more specific information.

<h3>Why blog?</h3>
We are blogging because our goal is to provide transparent and accurate information on new developments in addition to
research on markets and countries across the region.

<h3>What will you be blogging about?</h3>
This blog is really an extension of what we do for individual clients. We will blog about new developments, latest
_independent_ research as well as economic and legal issues that affect property investors. Our guiding principle 
- in big-picture terms - is to provide _more_ information and _more_ data to improve the knowledge of buyers and thus
increase the efficiency of the market.

<h3>How can I get in touch?</h3>
We actively encourage comments on our blog. We expect and kindly request that all comments stay on topic
and civilised, but other than that we hope to spark healthy debate. You may also email us at
<a href="mailto:info@realestasia.com">info@realestasia.com</a> if you have any questions, comments or feedback.
